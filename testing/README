These test drivers illustrate how you can test the individual functions
for this project.  You can expand them with additional test cases, or
use them as the basis for writing test programs for the other functions
you must test.

Copy the assembly language implementations you wish to test into this
directory,

Next, if your add_to_cust_list() and add_to_part_list() routines use your
cmp_cust() and cmp_part(), use the Makefile.cmp:

	cp Makefile.cmp Makefile

Otherwise, use the no-cmp version:

	cp Makefile.no-cmp Makefile

To use the tests, run one of the following commands to compile the test
programs:

	make test_add_cust	compiles test of add_to_cust_list()
	make test_cmp_cust	compiles test of cmp_cust()
	make test_find_cust	compiles test of find_cust()
	make test_new_cust	compiles test of new_cust()
	make test_add_part	compiles test of add_to_part_list()
	make test_cmp_part	compiles test of cmp_part()
	make test_find_part	compiles test of find_part()
	make test_new_part	compiles test of new_part()

	make			compiles all test programs

If you want to run them all:

	make run		compiles and runs all test programs
